    <p class="subHead"> 1. Analytical Mindset </p>
    <p>To be a good web developer, you need to have a natural curiosity towards new technology. A developer should have good systems-level thinking skills. You must have to capable to breakdown your problem in different steps with a clear understanding in an efficient way. You need to have a passion for problem-solving as no matter what type of developer you are. When a bug or an issue arises, you need to be able to investigate its cause and learn about the problem before you can solve it effectively.</p>

    <p class="subHead">2. Continuous learner</p>
    <p>"Web developers are never done learning" according to Steven Collins, co-founder of New York City-based Webb Communications.</p>
<p>The world of computer technology changes almost every day, and to keep pace with it, a web developer needs to be technologically in tune with the changes in the industry. If you’re the type to scour YouTube and web developer blogs for tutorials and inspiration and just can’t wait to jump in and start learning new techniques, you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>New scripts, widgets and designs are released daily so web developers must stay up to date to remain relevant in the industry. Slice out a segment of your work-day or week and dedicate it to learning new things in your field. Find out what's new, what's trending, and what's falling to the wayside. If you don’t want to see your competitors take away your job by appearing to be newer and fresher than you, pay heed to this tip.</p>
<p>A good way of staying up-to-date is by subscribed popular weekly/monthly tech news letters. By monitoring those, you can spot trends in what customers are looking for and what other developers are providing.There’s always something new to learn with tech, which is a huge draw for so many in the industry. You’ll always stay on your toes, expanding your knowledge.</p>
    


    <p class="subHead"> 3. Effective Communication Skills </p>
    <p>It’s important to maintain open lines of communication and be able to translate technical jargon into layman’s terms for other team members. If you have children, you’ve probably become a skilled simplifier when trying to explain complex subjects to your curious kiddos. If you can do a decent job of explaining why the sky is blue to a 5-year-old, you should have a pretty good handle on simplifying the language used to describe a technical problem to a client. Web developers must work with multiple members of an organization to ensure everyone’s goals are being met through the website.Developers need to be better in two ways: breadth and depth. They need to understand the breadth of human interactions in their team and with the things they build. They need to understand the depth of the system they're working with, down to the O/S.</p>
    <p class="subHead"> Opportunities :</p>
    <p> Conferences come with great opportunities rather than call for a job or getting hired. You can start making open source contributions, sign-up to work on a group project, and share your interesting project ideas with the people who may want to give you funding. </p>
     
        <p class="subHead">4. Team Player</p>
    <p>As a developer, you’ll not only work with other web developers, designers, and engineers but also other teams across your company. You may find yourself working closely with a marketing, support or sales team, or working directly with clients. So, you must be able to work well on a team.Whether you’re working remotely or alongside your team, collaboration and communication with your peers and stakeholders is paramount to success. When working on a project, you should be comfortable asking superiors, clients or peers questions to ensure you understand expectations and requirements.
        </p>


    <p class="subHead">5. Personal Qualities</p>
    <p>A competitive web developer has a range of mature positive personality traits such as - Adaptability, Perfectionism, Patience, Flexibility, Passion.   </p>





     <p class="subHead">Before You Go…</p>
    <p>“Everyone wants a website.As a web developer, you’ll never be short on work. I mean never!” says Brandon Swift, co-founder of Santa Barbara-based Volt Commerce .</p>
