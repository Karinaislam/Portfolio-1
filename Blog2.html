        <p class="subHead"> 5 Reasons should you start the #100DaysOfCode Challenge</p>
        <p>I have started my #100dayofcoding challenge 92 days ago (Still Continuing). I spend at least one-hour coding for every day (even weekends and vacations) in a row and <a class="anchorInBody" href="https://twitter.com/KarinaIslam2">tweet</a>  my progress daily with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Before that my progress of learning code was slow. I found myself skipping days and saying to myself that “It was a busy day and I’m tired now”, "I'll do it tomorrow", “I'm am traveling now” “It’s the weekend/holiday”. That's why after reading an article about it I just took the challenge. Now I’m going to tell you why you should also start this challenge.</p>

    <p class="subHead"> Push yourself to the next level </p>
    <p>Who doesn't want to see herself at the next level? If today's fast-paced life is not giving you the time to engage in continuous learning you must take the initiative for yourself. As soon as you start coding everyday it will keep you on the path of learning and you will keep growing. And helps you become a better version of yourself. While I am working on this challenge the fulfillment of coding everyday boosted my self-esteem also.</p>

    <p class="subHead">Get a Systematic Lifestyle</p>
    <p>After joining this challenge, coding will become a part of your daily lifestyle (like brushing your teeth, eating your lunch). And this consistency will help you to be a better developer. Achieving your daily coding goal and tweeting about it might even become more exciting than your weekend plans with your friends (It happens to me!!). And it gives you a good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day. </p>
   
    <p class="subHead">Build a strong profile</p>
    <p> During this challenge, you will able to complete a lot of projects, learn about new things and could become master about any specific topic. These things will make your profile stronger and more appealing to employers. In addition, your GitHub profile will also look extremely attractive.</p>

      <p class="qoutes">“I completed 100 days of code. Also, after completion, my title changed and I do half coding and half testing now instead of full testing. Each month more testing responsibilities will go spread through the team and I will get more coding responsibilities. I am thinking of starting 100 days of code again.” — Robert Jorgensen</p>
  
  
      
      <p class="qoutes">“I’ve completed 100 Days of Code once. Going to start again in September. I haven’t looked for a job, but it’s helped me do my job better and got me involved in open source 
      projects.” — Amy Carney

    <p class="subHead">Practice accountability</p>
    <p>
            When you go public with your goal you become more likely to stick to your commitment. Because people want to act in a way that is consistent with their commitment intentions. It will also force you to move towards the direction you want. and stay there. This type of personal accountability leads to a long-term commitment effect and makes sure you don’t give up.</p>
    
   <p class="qoutes"> “When you make your goals public, you receive a combination of responses you can use to fuel your desire to succeed!”

    <p>During the 100 days, I have built several projects, had a lot of fun, and made a lot of friends. And also planning to start a new round of it. So, take this challenge and start a new journey of your life.</p>
