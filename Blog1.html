<!-- Introduction -->
<div class="mainContent">
        <p class="subHead"> As a newbie why should you attend conferences?</p>
        <p>Conferences are short and practical opportunities to learn new information and make valuable contacts. 
                There are a lot of reasons to attend a conference beyond meeting the awesome speakers, the swag bags, 
                and the food. Here are a few-</p>
    <div>
        <div class="BlogPostCover">
                <img class="coverImgBlog" src="./images/Blog1.1.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
        </div>
           
    
    
    <p class="subHead"> Get Inspirations:  </p>
    <p>Surrounded by like-minded people, you will discover that you’re not alone in wanting to improve your skills. Other people stories will motivate and encourage you to push yourself to the next level. I met Allison at that conference in 2017 where she told me how she switched her career and became a self-taught developer and landed in her first developer job. That inspires me a lot.</p>

    <p class="subHead">Hear from the experts</p>
    <p>You can learn many things from those inspiring talks delivered by the experts in your field. You have the opportunity to ask presenters questions about their work and the rationale behind it, which you can’t do when reading articles.
        </p>
    
    <p class="subHead"> Get real-time Feedback:</p>
    <p>Another great thing about conferences is that you can share what you’re working on and get feedback from others who know the ins and outs of your field. Also joining a conference will give you the opportunity to ask something specific that you want to know or discuss with the experts the weird problems that you are facing. 
            Ref: https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-great-reasons-to-attend-conferences-as-a-new-grad
           .</p>
    <p class="subHead"> Opportunities :</p>
    <p> Conferences come with great opportunities rather than call for a job or getting hired. You can start making open source contributions, sign-up to work on a group project, and share your interesting project ideas with the people who may want to give you funding. </p>
     
        <p class="subHead">For a change of scenery:</p>
    <p>Being stuck in the same environment at the same desk, doing the same routine and seeing the same people can have a detrimental effect on your productivity and creativity, and leave you stuck in a rut. Nothing beats like traveling to a new place to experience different surroundings, cultures and inspiring people. Being in a new environment can spark a new approaches and get those creative juices flowing again!
        </p>


    <p class="subHead"> Learn something outside your field:</p>
    <p>Sometimes exploring beyond your field can prove extremely rewarding and.Join an open session to learn how to become a conference speaker or organizer. Or attend a workshop to learn what motivates you in work. Or totally different session how to preserve your work for at least 5,000 years. It will give you a totally different direction of your thinking.

            </p>


    <p class="subHead"> Networking:</p>
    <p>Who doesn't like getting to know and meet new people who work in the same industry? It is the opportunity to talk to people one-on-one and learn what they are working on. Besides meeting new people by networking, you may get a fresh idea, a positive influence, access to a new opportunity, advice & support to enhance your own work. As a newbie, you can make a connection with the other people over coffee, lunch, or cocktails time.
        </p>


    <p class="subHead"> Confidence:</p>
    <p>By regularly networking, and pushing yourself to talk to people you don’t know, you will develop confidence the more times you do this. This is really important as a newbie because your growth is very dependant on talking to people and making connections.
            I was certainly not confident when I started networking. In fact, it completely petrified me! But as I do it more, the more confident I feel and the easier it becomes. And  I get more benefits from it.
            .</p>


    <p class="subHead"> For a strong profile:</p>
    <p>Obviously attending a lot of conferences enriches your knowledge level which makes your profile stronger. When you learn more from others, you grow faster. </p>


    <p>The main reason for attending conferences is to increase our knowledge.  We know that most information is already somewhere on the web, But accessing it depends on one-way communication that doesn’t allow you to easily follow-up. But attending a conference make it easier for you to ask something specific that you want to know or discuss the unusual problems that you are facing the experts. You can also learn about the newest industry trends and technologies which help you broaden your horizons and gain a complete view of the industry.</p>




     <p class="subHead">Before You Go…</p>
    <p>“Everyone wants a website.As a web developer, you’ll never be short on work. I mean never!” says Brandon Swift, co-founder of Santa Barbara-based Volt Commerce .</p>

    
<p>Don't just go through it. Snached it!!!</p>
